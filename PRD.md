# PRD: Branching Stories

## Executive Summary

**Branching Stories** is a feature that transforms the existing AI chat application into a collaborative storytelling tool with branching narratives. Users can fork any conversation at any message point to explore alternate storylines, creating a tree of possibilities rather than a single linear conversation.

The core insight is simple: when co-writing a story with AI, you often wonder "what if the character had done something different?" Instead of losing your current narrative thread, you fork it and explore both paths. This creates a "choose your own adventure" authoring experience where multiple storylines can be developed simultaneously.

**MVP Goal**: Enable users to fork a conversation from any message, creating a new conversation branch that preserves all messages up to the fork point. Users can then develop multiple narrative branches independently and switch between them easily.

## Mission

**Mission Statement**: Empower creative writers to explore infinite narrative possibilities by making it effortless to branch, explore, and manage multiple storylines within a single AI-assisted writing session.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Non-destructive exploration** — Forking never loses or modifies the original conversation
2. **Minimal friction** — One click to fork, immediate editing in the new branch
3. **Clear lineage** — Always know where a branch came from
4. **Familiar UX** — Build on existing chat patterns, don't reinvent them

## Target Users

**Primary Persona: Creative Writer**
- Uses AI as a collaborative writing partner
- Writes interactive fiction, short stories, or explores narrative ideas
- Comfortable with chat-based AI interfaces
- Wants to explore "what if" scenarios without losing work

**Key Needs**:
- Explore multiple story directions without commitment
- Keep track of different narrative branches
- Easily switch between storylines
- Understand the relationship between branches

## MVP Scope

### In Scope (Core Functionality)
- ✅ Fork button on each message in a conversation
- ✅ Create new conversation containing messages up to fork point
- ✅ New conversation titled with branch indicator (e.g., "Story (branch)")
- ✅ Visual indicator in sidebar showing branched conversations
- ✅ Branch metadata stored (parent conversation ID, fork message ID)

### In Scope (Technical)
- ✅ Database schema updates for branch tracking
- ✅ New fork API endpoint
- ✅ Service layer function for forking logic
- ✅ UI components for fork action

### Out of Scope (Future)
- ❌ Tree visualization of all branches
- ❌ Side-by-side branch comparison view
- ❌ Merging branches back together
- ❌ Branch renaming UI
- ❌ Nested branching (branches of branches) — technically works, but no special UI
- ❌ Sharing/exporting branch trees
- ❌ Branch search/filtering

## User Stories

**1. Fork a Story Branch**
> As a writer, I want to fork my story at any message, so that I can explore an alternate direction without losing my current storyline.

*Example*: I'm writing a mystery. The detective finds a clue. I fork here — in one branch she follows the clue, in another she ignores it. Both stories continue independently.

**2. See Branch Origin**
> As a writer, I want to see that a conversation is a branch and where it came from, so that I understand its context.

*Example*: In the sidebar, I see "Mystery Story" and indented below it "Mystery Story (branch)". I know the branch relates to the original.

**3. Continue Writing in Branch**
> As a writer, I want to immediately continue writing in a new branch after forking, so that my creative flow isn't interrupted.

*Example*: I click fork, a new conversation opens with all prior messages, my cursor is ready in the input field.

**4. Switch Between Branches**
> As a writer, I want to easily switch between my story branches, so that I can develop multiple storylines in one session.

*Example*: I click between "Mystery Story" and its branch in the sidebar, each shows its own message history.

**5. Identify Fork Points**
> As a writer, I want to know which message I forked from, so that I remember why I created this branch.

*Example*: The branch shows a subtle indicator or the forked-from message is highlighted.

## Core Architecture & Patterns

### Approach
Extend the existing vertical slice architecture. Add branch tracking to the database schema and create a new `forkConversation` service function that:
1. Creates a new conversation with parent reference
2. Copies all messages up to and including the fork point
3. Returns the new conversation for immediate use

└── hooks/use-chat.ts                # Add forkConversation action
```

### Design Patterns
- **Vertical Slice**: Fork feature follows existing chat feature patterns
- **Immutable Forking**: Original conversation is never modified
- **Eager Copy**: Messages are copied at fork time (not referenced)

## Features

### Fork Button
- **Location**: Each message bubble, visible on hover
- **Icon**: Git branch icon or similar (🔀)
- **Action**: Calls fork API, switches to new conversation

### Branch Indicator (Sidebar)
- **Visual**: Indentation or icon showing conversation is a branch
- **Grouping**: Branches appear near their parent conversation
- **Label**: Title includes "(branch)" suffix by default

### Fork API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/chat/conversations/[id]/fork`
- **Input**: `{ messageId: string }` — the message to fork from
- **Output**: `{ conversation: Conversation }` — the new branch
- **Logic**: Create conversation with parent ref, copy messages, return new conversation

## Technology Stack

**Existing Stack (No Changes)**:
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Supabase Postgres + Drizzle ORM
- Bun runtime

**New Dependencies**: None required

## Security & Configuration

**Authentication**: Uses existing Supabase Auth — no changes needed

**Authorization**: Fork operation requires no special permissions; users fork their own conversations

**Database**: Uses existing `TABLE_PREFIX` pattern for workshop isolation (`jf_` prefix)

## API Specification

### Fork Conversation

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/chat/conversations/[id]/fork`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "messageId": "uuid-of-message-to-fork-from"
}
```

**Response** (201 Created):
```json
{
  "conversation": {
    "id": "new-conversation-uuid",
    "title": "Original Title (branch)",
    "parentConversationId": "original-conversation-uuid",
    "branchFromMessageId": "uuid-of-message-to-fork-from",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors**:
- `404`: Conversation or message not found
- `400`: Message doesn't belong to conversation

## Future Considerations

**Post-MVP Enhancements**:
- Tree visualization showing full branch structure
- Side-by-side comparison of branches
- Custom branch naming
- Branch search and filtering
- "Story mode" UI optimized for narrative writing

**Advanced Features**:
- Merge branches (combine storylines)
- Export story tree to structured format
- Share public story trees
- Collaborative branching (multiple authors)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Database migration complexity | Could block progress | Use direct SQL in setup script, matching existing pattern |
| Fork operation slow with many messages | Poor UX | Keep MVP scope small; optimize later if needed |
| Time overrun | Incomplete feature | Focus on core fork flow first; branch visualization is optional polish |
| UI complexity | Confusing for users | Start with minimal UI (just a fork button + title suffix) |
